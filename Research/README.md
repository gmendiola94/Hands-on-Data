## Abstract üìÉ

Scholars have extensively examined the effects of event studies in finance, such as
that of unexpected corporate events and respective abnormal returns on the stock
market. Nonetheless, there is still a research gap on the extent of the forecastability of
this abnormal behaviour, especially when predictions may provide crucial information
to both investors and issuers, and therefore drive effectively investment decisions. </br>
In this study we forecast the value effect of SEOs and Stock Splits, across developed and
emerging economies. </br> 
Data consist of historical **information from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and Brazil Stock Exchange (B3)** from 2010 to 2020. **Linear regression
(benchmark), random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector regression
and neural networks methods** are empirically evaluated, with non-linear models
performing better than the benchmark. A trading simulation is also incorporated to
complement model outcomes and determine whether these predictions could be
capitalised through effective decision making in the investment spectrum. Finally, the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were also analysed for SEOs in the NYSE, and
significant differences were discovered in March and April 2020.



### Skills üõ†Ô∏è

* Capital IQ/Thomson Reuters platforms to get source equity data and events 
* MS SQL Server to preprocess and shape data
* Power BI to display high-level Exchange observations and compare their returns (financial model outputs)
* Python to implement machine learning and web scraping algorithms


## TL;DR ‚è©
* 	Forecasted the value effect (abnormal returns) of SEOs and Stock Splits events across developed and emerging economies.
* 	Performed a trading simulation to determine whether model predictions could be capitalised.
