# Challenge 11B: Cost Prediction Model ðŸ’ª
**Can we develop an accurate and robust machine learning model to improve cost forecasting on construction projects?**
</br>
A challenge that builds on the work of the Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with the University of Nottingham. This challenge intends to improve cost forecasting and/modelling to make it an automated and efficient way to reduce cost.
